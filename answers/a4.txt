In twilight's hush, where shadows play,
The forest whispers secrets of the day.
The trees, like sentinels of earth and sky,
Stand guard, their leaves a gentle sigh.

The wind, a wanderer, roams free and wide,
Through canopies above, a soothing tide.
It stirs the petals, soft as skin,
And carries scents from blooms within.

In moonlit glades, where night's sweet peace
Descends like silence, darkness release,
The stars appear, a twinkling sea,
A celestial tapestry, infinite and free.

The river flows, a silver thread,
Through valleys green, where wildflowers spread.
Its gentle voice, a lullaby,
Echoes through the forest, wild and high.

In nature's realm, I find my home,
A place of wonder, where my heart is known.
A world of beauty, full of might,
Where every breath is filled with delight.
